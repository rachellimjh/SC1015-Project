# SC1015-Project

### Our dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset
## Problem Statement: 
### Can we use machine learning models to predict which users are most likely to convert(purchase), using Revenue(True/False) as our responder, based on their behaviour and attributes(eg returning type)? 
#### 1. Time spent on the website (Administrative Duration, Informational Duration, Product Related Duration, Bounce Rates)
#### 2. Time period(special day/weekend/month)
#### 3. Visitor attributes (returning type,region)
### Which machine learning model is the best in predicting so?
