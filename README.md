# SC1015-Project

## Can we use machine learning models to predict which users are most likely to convert(purchase), based on their behaviour and attributes(eg returning type)? 
### 1. Time spent on the website
### 2. Time period(special day/weekend/month)
### 3. Visitor attributes (returning type,region)
## Which machine learning model is the best in predicting so?
