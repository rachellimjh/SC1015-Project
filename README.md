### Our dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis 


### Which machine learning model is the best in predicting so?


# SC1015: Intro to Data Science and AI Mini Project
### Problem Statement: 
### Predict the likelihood of a customer responding to a marketing campaign based on their historical campaign responses, purchase behaviour, and demographic attributes. Thus, we are able to better improve and design campaigns such that the likelihood of them responding to future campaigns is higher. 

## Description
This project focuses on using consumer's attributes to study their behaviour and how it affects a company's revenue and performance. This repository contains the Customer Personality Analysis dataset, our finalised code as well as the video presentation.

## Models used
1. Linear Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Clustering
4. Random Forest Model

## Conclusion 
* Likelihood of customers participating in the company's campaign can be predicted using clustering
* Companies can tweak their marketing techniques to cater to families with children, earn below the mean income and spend less
* Clustering does improve the accuracy of the data but not significant in terms of predicting response 


## What we learnt
* Peforming feature engineering to improve usability of data
* Support Vector Machine
* Clustering
* Radnom Forest Model
* Collaboration on GitHub
* Concepts on scaling, kernels, Elbow method, gridsearch
