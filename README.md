# SC1015: Intro to Data Science and AI Mini Project

## Description
This project focuses on using consumer's attributes to study their behaviour and how it affects a company's revenue and performance. This repository contains the Customer Personality Analysis dataset, our [finalised code](https://github.com/rachellimjh/SC1015-Project/blob/dev-Rheanne/SC1015%20Mini%20Project.ipynb) as well as the video presentation.

### Problem Statement: 
Utilising the chosen dataset, Customer Personality Analysis, coupled with various machine learning models, predict the likelihood of Customers responding to marketing campaigns.

On top of that, we analysed which factors influence the companyâ€™s revenue through studying the relationship between consumer traits and total expenditure. This allows companies to fine tune marketing strategies and increase revenue. 

Additionally, find the best machine learning model which best predicts revenue and customers' response to marketing strategies.

## Conclusion 
* Likelihood of customers participating in the company's campaign can be predicted using clustering
* Companies can tweak their marketing techniques to cater to families with children, earn below the mean income and spend less
* Clustering does improve the accuracy of the data but not significant in terms of predicting response 
* ....
